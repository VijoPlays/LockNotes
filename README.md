# LockNotes ![build](https://github.com/VijoPlays/LockNotes/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg) 

An Open Source App for Android to display some notes on the lock screen for people with a short term memory that's as good as mine. 

The app was specifically made for my Sony Xperia Z1, and I have no clue about Android App design, so the UI is probably borked if you're not using that phone. Feel free to modify it though, I doubt I will work much on it.
